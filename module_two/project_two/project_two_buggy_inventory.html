<p>You just received an email from your friend Kant D. Bugg! It looks
like he’s in desperate need of some help! Read the email and figure out
what’s going on!</p>
<pre><code>Dear friend,

Thank you so much for the wonderful code for the mock UI! We were so happy when we got it! It inspired us to get back into 
things, so Kant C. and I had a crack at some other parts of the inventory system. I tried implementing a system to track 
shipments, but I ended up having all sorts of weird things happen when I messed up the input. It also seems like I can&#39;t enter 
more than one word for the shipment type? I wasn&#39;t sure what was going on, so I tried debugging a bit, but I&#39;m really not 
great at it.

As for Kant C., he also had problems. He couldn&#39;t see what the problems were with his code, so Kant B. stepped in to help. 
Perhaps &quot;help&quot; is a strong word, here, since he always thinks his code is better than everyone else&#39;s, and he never thinks he 
can have bugs in his own code. Long story short, he tried some things, but his version didn&#39;t really work either. It seems 
they were both using some new data types and some new syntax I wasn&#39;t familiar with, so I wasn&#39;t able to help them.

Could you please figure out what&#39;s going on, and could you explain it in comments in the code? Would you also be able to fix the 
code so we could see how it should have been done? C. and B. couldn&#39;t figure out the formatting thing you did, either, so 
could you format their table correctly, too?

I owe you big time! I&#39;ve included some comments in my code detailing my questions and concerns. Below, you&#39;ll also find some 
examples of some of the things I tried.

Your friend,
Kant D. Bugg
