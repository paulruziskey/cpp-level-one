<p>You just received an email from your friend Kant D. Bugg! It looks
like he’s in desperate need of some help! Read the email and figure out
what’s going on! It reads as follows.</p>
<p>Dear friend,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the wonderful code for the mock UI! We were so
happy when we got it! It inspired us to get back into things, so Kant C.
and I had a crack at some other parts of the inventory system. I tried
implementing a system to track shipments, but I ended up having all
sorts of weird things happen when I messed up the input. It also seems
like I can’t enter more than one word for the shipment type? I wasn’t
sure what was going on, so I tried debugging a bit, but I’m really not
great at it.</p>
<p>As for Kant C., he also had problems. He couldn’t see what the
problems were with his code, so Kant B. stepped in to help. Perhaps
“help” is a strong word, here, since he always thinks his code is better
than everyone else’s, and he never thinks he can have bugs in his own
code. Long story short, he tried some things, but his version didn’t
really work either. It seems they were both using some new data types
and some new syntax I wasn’t familiar with, so I wasn’t able to help
them.</p>
<p>Could you please figure out what’s going on, and could you explain it
in comments in the code? Would you also be able to fix the code so we
could see how it should have been done? C. and B. couldn’t figure out
the formatting thing you did, either, so could you format their table
correctly, too?</p>
<p>I owe you big time! I’ve included some comments in my code detailing
my questions and concerns. Below, you’ll also find some examples of some
of the things I tried.</p>
