<p>Your friends the Bugg brothers have decided to open a grocery store.
They all have a large programming background, but none of them are
really that good at programming. They wanted to make sure their grocery
store was on the cutting edge of technology, so they decided to try
programming their own inventory system.</p>
<p>The first thing they started with was the user interface. However, it
looks like this is as far as they got! Their UI didn’t look like they
pictured at all!</p>
<p>The Bugg brothers managed to convince you to make a better version of
their UI (they were really broken up over this, and you wanted them to
focus on attending to their new customers). The only catch: they need it
programmed in C++. You only just started programming in C++, but you’re
willing to learn a thing or two about basic variables and user input and
output!</p>
<p>The Bugg brothers want you to make a mock inventory system with a UI
that asks the user for information on three products to be added to the
inventory system. The information for each product should consist of a
<em>name</em>, a <em>price</em>, and a <em>net weight</em>. The Bugg
brothers also mentioned that they needed the prices to be stored as
integers to avoid floating-point errors, but that the prices should be
displayed like normal.</p>
<p>Below is a mock-up they put together for what they want the output of
the mock inventory system to look like.</p>
<pre><code>Here is the current inventory:
| Product         | Price   | Net Wt. |
| apple           |    1.11 |    0.59 |
| banana          |    0.97 |    0.33 |
| milk            |    2.56 |    1.13 |</code></pre>
<p>They said this system needs to work for multiple kinds of products,
not just the ones shown in the mock-up. They warned you that they
struggled a lot with avoiding hard-coding the spacing between the
columns in the table, so you’ll also need to figure out how to output
information in a table with consistent column widths!</p>
<p>The Bugg brothers can’t thank you enough!</p>
<p>They also included an example of what they want the program’s output
to be below.</p>
